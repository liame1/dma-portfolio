                ARTIST STATEMENT <br>
                I am an artist who is passionate about creating. Currently, I am working towards becoming a Digital Media
                Arts student. I believe the DMA program will help me learn and develop the skills I need in order to
                work in one of my desired industries.</p>

                VISION <br>
                For my portfolio, I want to create something that is very interactive. I was thinking I could go with
                something more stylized, maybe take aspects from the user interfaces of video games I have played in the
                past as inspiration. I would also like to incorporate a 3d aspect into my website, recently Iâ€™ve been
                learning blender which may be useful in helping me to achieve this.
                I have yet to decide whether I want to have my website be more pastel and soft, or conversely, vibrant
                and sharp. I don't really have a particular style, I actually might end up having both aspects which
                could potentially make the site more interesting. I think I will just play it by ear and see what
                happens.
