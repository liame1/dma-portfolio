                <h3>ARTIST STATEMENT // PURPOSE:</h3>
                <img src="images/liam-preview.jpg">
                <p>“Liam is an artist that simply must create, he is also confused why he is writing about himself in
                    the
                    third-person. Anyway... Every day, I wake up inspired by the colors of the sky,
                    the sounds of the universe, and the infinite possibilities of the human spirit. My art is a
                    motivated by my soul, dreams, and caffiene. I love watching people connect
                    with my work, it’s like a cosmic collaboration between my imagination and their
                    metaphorical-metaphysical perception of the universe. I wish to continue learning new skills that
                    will broaden my
                    potential of what I can create, and further my goals. My current goal is to learn how to properly
                    use the ctrl+s shortcut before my program crashes. I would also like to learn how to make pizza.</p>
