                            This is a poster I made using photoshop, the letters in the top-left section were done by a
                            good friend of mine, which I then scanned and edited to fit. The cityscape was
                            created by using a screenshot I took from the video game Jet Set Radio Future.

                            found it fun to create, aswell as more entertaining.

                            designing the car, I imagined each piece and how they would be layered together. I used the
                            design of formula-1 racecars as reference, but wanted to simplified the cars details as much
                            as possible while

                            This object sadly never made it into the game, so I thought
                            it would be notable to create its 3d existence.

                            greatly was making the facial features more elongated by scaling them along the z-axis.
