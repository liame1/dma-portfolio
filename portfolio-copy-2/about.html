                <img src="images/liam-preview.jpg">
                <p>I am passionate about creating, and I love being inspired. I enjoy seeing what I'm able to create, and
                how others interact with what I make. I am very interested in video games and 3d modeling, I think
                it would be really cool to have my creations displayed in playable video games. I would also love to see
                how my 3d models could exist in the physical world through digital fabrication. I have leaned lots about
                web development through this program and would love to see how far I take it, the website you are
                currently viewing has been coded by me from scratch using Visual Studio code. I feel it is necessary for
                me to be in the Digital Media Arts program as many of my aspirations align with the content that is
                taught. I wish to continue learning new skills that will broaden my potential of what I can create to
                further my existing goals.</p>
